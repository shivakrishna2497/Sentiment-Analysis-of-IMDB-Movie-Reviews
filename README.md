# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Movie-Reviews


The IMDB movie reviews dataset is a set of 50,000 reviews, half of which are positive and the other half negative.     The dataset is available online and can be either directly downloaded from Stanford’s website or obtained by running in a terminal (Linux):


wget http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz    


Then, we need to extract the dowloaded files. You can once again either do it manually or by running:    


tar -zxvf aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
